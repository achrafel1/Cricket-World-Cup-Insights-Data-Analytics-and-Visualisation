# Project overview
In pursuit of optimising team composition for the upcoming ICC Cricket World Cup 2022, this project harnessed data analytics methodologies. It entailed extracting data from ESPN Cricinfo via web scraping, data transformation via Python and Pandas, and crafting dynamic dashboards through Power BI to provide visually engaging insights.

# üåêData Collection
Used "Bright Data" web scraper to effectively gather information from the ESPN Cricinfo website, including match data, results, player batting data, and bowling data. The scraped data was stored in the form of JSON for further processing.
  
# üßπData Transformation and Conversion
Utilised Python and Pandas to convert the JSON data into CSV format. Ensured the data was formatted appropriately for seamless integration with Power BI, streamlining table merging processes.

# ü™ÑExporting Data to Power BI:
Transferred the preprocessed data, as well as the outcomes of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and modeling stages, to Power BI in a compatible CSV file format.

# ‚öíÔ∏èCreate the Dashboard
Employed Power Query within Power BI to conduct additional data refinement and cleansing as part of the analysis process. Developed dynamic dashboards featuring interactive charts and visualisations, showcasing performance metrics across different categories, including power hitters, middle-order batsmen, and bowlers. These dashboards delivered valuable insights into player capabilities, team strengths, and areas for enhancement.
